# Graph-Important-Problems

#Introduction:
Graph is a data structure which has two components:
Node/Vertex
Edge (which connects two nodes)
Types of graph:
i. Directed Graph
ii. Undirected Graph
Degree in a graph:
i. The number of edges that are incoming or outgoing in a graph.
ii. In an undirected graph there are degerees.
->Total degree of all the nodes = 2*edges.
iii. In a directed graph there are:
->Indegree (Incoming edge)
-> Outdegree (Outgoing edge)
Path:
* Path is a sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeating or visited more than once.
Cyclic graph:
* If there is a cycle in an undirected graph we can call that as an undirected cyclic graph.
Undirected acylic graph: Tree/no cycle.
-> If there is a cycle in a directed graph we can call that as a directed cyclic graph.
* Directed acyclic graph: No cycle.
Weighted graph:
->Weighted directed graph.
* Weighted undirected graph.
